# 5 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
# Description
The project is to add functionality to a HTML page that is a daily planner. By adding code, the project was meant to display the day and keep track of events for the current day that can be saved, re-written, and retrived from local storage. Also it uses color cording to label events relevant to the current time of the day.

# Installation

Note: This assignment was completed outside the 9AM-5pm, so all objects in demo shown as past but they were assigned future by default so the color coding is functional.


# Usage
You can use this code to look at how to use the day.js object and utilize it to record or time objects in real time. The code's functionality helps look at DOM traversal using Jquery in how one can move around the HTML to locate and change/set attributes in a HTML page based on user input in real time and store them in local storage.
